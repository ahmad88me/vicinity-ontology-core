<p>Figure 1 provides a general overview of the current status of the VICINITY core ontology. It is worth noting that some elements might be deleted and the model is not final as it is still ongoing work. </p>

<p>In some cases it will be needed to represent that a sensor or an interaction pattern (property or event) monitors a given property (as defined in SSN ontology) of a particular feature of interest instead of a generic one. This also could be the case for actuators or actions acting on properties of particular features of interest. In order to allow the representation of this information being oble of unequivocally identify to which pair of "property, feature of interest" is being monitored/affected, we need to include a auxiliar class following a n-ary class pattern. In this sense, if a device observe 3 properties about 2 features of interest, we are able to identify which particular properties are observed for each feature of interest. Figure 4 illustrates the model proposed for this n-ary pattern represented by the class core:FeatureProperty. It is worth noting than there have been defined de following property chains: </p>

<ul>
<li>core:monitorsFeatureProperty, core:aboutProperty &rarr; core:monitors</li>
<li>core:actsOnFeatureProperty, core:aboutProperty &rarr; core:actsOn</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="ex1"></a>Instantiating VICINITY core ontology <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>

<p>This section shows an example of an instantiation of the VICINITY core ontology. Such example aims to illustrate how to describe a given sensor, in this case a thermometer, using the core ontology and the WoT module. The example is graphically represented in Figure 4.</p>

<p>The device information represented in the example is the following:</p>

<p><strong>Name</strong>: Temperature Sensor 01</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: Thermometer</p>
<p><strong>GUID</strong>: 5072dd0b-c2f0-4744-9dd4-dff344d8e2bb</p>
<p><strong>Properties</strong>:</p>
<p>o<strong>Temperature</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Temperature</li>
<li><strong>Observed Property</strong>: Average temperature</li>
<li><strong>Datatype</strong>: Double</li>
<li><strong>Writable</strong>: no</li>
<li><strong>Units of measure</strong>: &ordm;C</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Events</strong>:</p>
<p>o<strong>Temperature</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Temperature New Value</li>
<li><strong>Observed Property</strong>: Average temperature</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capabilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: 100 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: 0.3 &ordm;C</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: 1 &ordm;C</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 0 - 40 &ordm;C</li>
</ul>
